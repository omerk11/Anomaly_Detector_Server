This project purpose (part of PTM course) is to desgin an Anomaly Detector for time serties Data.
Project contains ML and DS elemants both on server and customer side, and using algorithm based on data.
During this project I've designed an Anomaly detector with train method for findind the correlation between each feature, and implemented a real-time anomaly detector
for detecting anomalies on real time.
The second section is to design a CLI Anomaly Detector server that is based on my Anomaly detector and function according to the client side operations.
